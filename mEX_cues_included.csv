sub_2_conv_3  ,So the other day I was really afraid because I think I saw someone die. There was someone that was going down the stairs at one of the stations and he fell and I thought he was going to be okay but he wasn't moving and there was blood and stuff.

sub_3_conv_1  ,nice that is I didn't know that actually it's really interesting I've heard it was done with coke but I had to check that I'm going to set it up like overnight but yeah I may actually check that and see if I can do that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          ,"I think it's also supposed to be with Coke, but you can do it with Sprite.

sub_5_conv_4  ,No that's the funny thing like I actually only slept like six hours instead of the usual eight but I ended up waking up early and feeling refreshed and I think that's weird but I mean it's a welcome weird instead of a bad weird.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  ,Maybe you ate something weird yesterday that's why sometimes stomach problems can cause people to have weird sleep-sick schedules or something.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        ,0.09136177    ,0.33604527   ,0.57259303   ,0.8841043    ,0.11225154   ,0.0036441975 ,             0 ,0.126526315789474   ,-0.158842105263158   ,-0.109684210526316   ,-0.161454545454545   ,-0.142727272727273   ,-0.192               ,        45 ,        21 ,0.000381978636141866 ,0.000419660325860605 ,6.63946484564803E-05 ,3.78495496988762E-05 ,0.00101917912252247  ,0.993724524974823    ,0.00399469491094351  ,0.000128330779261887  ,0.000227277123485692 ,      0 ,      1

sub_7_conv_3  ,Thanks for asking. Actually they are coming in a few months to visit me and my family. So I'm also very excited about that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,Sounds great.

Back in my country I used to go at least twice a week and I really enjoy it but here I don't have the chance.                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,Oh that's bad.

sub_11_conv_4 ,yeah I did end up complaining actually the manager wasn't that helpful they were also telling me that I had was trying to scam the restaurant which made me more mad because I think that they were trying to cover for the for the cook who did that and it just kind of ruined the reputation of that restaurant for me                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             ,right I get it Maybe some people try to actually cheat and do what they thought you was doing.

sub_11_conv_4 ,I think it's more like a tactic. I don't think it's like that common that people scam and I think that's really really bad behavior on the part of the of the restaurants because even if someone is trying to scam like the restaurant it's still like something that they should take into account and I don't think you can fake a hair inside of the food                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ,"Right, so you had the evidence.

sub_11_conv_5 ,so this is going to sound really crazy but I think I may have actually seen a ghost the other night like I was walking and it was the middle of the night and it was in the countryside so there was no one around and I was feeling pretty nervous you know it's dangerous and stuff but then I saw two little lights like the reflections from eyes and I thought it was a dog or something but I shine my flashlight over there and then I see that the two dots like stand straight up and I just I was so terrified I ran all the way back home.                                                 ,"Wow.

sub_12_conv_3 ,I've been feeling bad the whole morning. I even have a headache because I cannot sleep well. And it's just because of my noisy neighbors.

They continue being just very loud at night.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 ,I'm sorry to hear that but I also don't know what to do for you.

sub_13_conv_2 ,"For here it's really important to have everything perfectly clean, but for me it's not like that. So I prefer spending time in other things like playing video games. but I guess I need to have like a balance not not only playing all the time at least that's what she wants and I'm also trying to to do it because it's good for me and for for us but I couldn't this time like last week I just play video games"                                                                                                                                                                            ,I think when living with other person it can be difficult and talking it's very important for the relationship so if you cannot maybe understand each other probably in the future it can be harder in other things like having if you get more serious like having maybe child or getting marriage could be more complicated so but yeah but living with your girlfriend it's a good step just to kind of test in the relationship so I think you shouldn't worry about who cleans but if you are having a bad life maybe you need to resolve this.   ,0.16768035    ,0.45944896   ,0.37287065   ,0.17050096   ,0.5899706    ,0.23952845   ,             0 ,0.338230769230769   ,-0.131923076923077   ,-0.0326153846153846  ,0.320514285714286    ,-0.0577142857142857  ,0.0573714285714286   ,        82 ,        99 ,0.00026743410853669  ,0.000287509028567001 ,6.86257335473783E-05 ,4.35657966590952E-05 ,0.000914734089747071 ,0.994040668010712    ,0.00395450694486499  ,0.000117049996333662  ,0.000305909052258357 ,      1 ,      2

Maybe I'm more afraid about the change than anything else because even though things are gonna change it's not for the worse I think it's for the better because I want my daughter to have a good life and I am sure like for her it's better if she leaves the house and also I should see that for us my wife and I like it could be also something good in a way that we can spend more time together by our ourselves"                                                                                                                                              ,"Yeah also for her living alone or in another house with her boyfriend or someone else can be good for personal growing.

sub_13_conv_4 ,Two weeks ago they released a new game that I really wanted to play because it looked just great. But it has like the newest technology so to play that game on PC you need the best equipment. So I spent thousands of dollars to get a new PC. I even borrowed some money from a friend. I've been playing the game for just a few days and it's really boring. I'm disappointed. And now I have this debt of a few thousand dollars that I have to pay for this game that at the end I didn't enjoy.                                                                                               ,"I'm sorry to hear that, but I haven't understand, did you buy also new equipment or only the new game?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               ,0.8854156     ,0.08975819   ,0.02482624   ,0.575139     ,0.3983395    ,0.026521517  ,             2 ,0.305151515151515   ,0.0261818181818182   ,0.00878787878787879  ,0.50275              ,0.04925              ,0.067                ,        99 ,        20 ,0.000392384652514011 ,0.000438050308730453 ,4.03305966756307E-05 ,3.64848565368447E-05 ,0.98946475982666     ,0.000341291743097827 ,0.00603180006146431  ,0.000514473125804216  ,0.00274047371931374  ,      1 ,      2

sub_14_conv_8 ,I reported it to the police and they will try to find the person responsible with the cameras and everything but so far like like we don't have any news of about this so I would have to pay for my treatment which is expensive and also I won't be able to walk well or like I mean I need to take care of my leg for the next few weeks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           ,that's so unfortunate and yeah I hope the police will find it it's so irresponsible is creating a lot of I mean you cannot go to work and you cannot also like walk well and everything is such a huge burden also physically and mentally I guess you cannot imagine that someone just like bite you in the middle of the street                                                                                                                                                                                                                      ,0.9136963     ,0.081416644  ,0.0048870314 ,0.9663467    ,0.030603075  ,0.0030503103 ,             2 ,0.227478260869565   ,-0.0847826086956522  ,0.0478260869565217   ,0.0842105263157895   ,-0.0448421052631579  ,0.0345263157894737   ,        71 ,        62 ,0.000381317484425381 ,0.0018448147457093   ,0.109489403665066    ,0.887313425540924    ,7.32634507585317E-05 ,0.000124536687508225 ,0.000108092819573358 ,0.000235903295106255  ,0.000429219973739237 ,      1 ,      3
